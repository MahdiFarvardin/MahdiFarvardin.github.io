<p>Hi there,</p>

<p><strong>“Starting 2024, I am actively seeking PhD positions in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, with a primary focus on Interpretability, NLP, Vision, and model explanation”</strong></p>

<p>I’m a senior master’s student in the field of AI and Machine Learning at <a href="http://www.iust.ac.ir/en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)</a> and happy to be supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=WN82kZoAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Morteza Analoui</a>.</p>

<p>My main research interest lies in the area of Interpretable AI, Causality and Machine Learning for healthcare.</p>

<p>Previously I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from <a href="https://uma.ac.ir/index.php?slc_lang=en&amp;sid=1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Mohaghegh Ardabili</a>, during that I was working under supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BwVBVpkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Adel Akbarimajd</a>.</p>
